## 📱 Overview

This app was developed as our graduation project. It enables users to:

- Detect skin diseases by uploading images analyzed by an AI model
- View and manage personal health reports
- Locate nearby dermatologists via Google Maps
- Get medical-style reports generated by GPT-4
- Save a full history of detections in the app

## 🧪 How It Works

1. User signs in and creates a profile
2. Uploads a skin image for detection
3. The image is processed using a FastAPI backend connected to a trained AI model
4. Detection result is sent back to the app
5. GPT-4 generates a brief medical-style explanation
6. The result and report are saved to the user's history
7. User can view nearby dermatologists on an embedded map
